# Project to install nixos on different platforms

## Introduction
The `nixos-install` repository is a project aimed at simplifying NixOS installations across various platforms. Our goal is to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience for setting up NixOS, regardless of the target environment.

## Initial Focus
Our initial focus is on setting up a NixOS aarch64 virtual machine (VM) running on macOS. We utilize the UTM QEMU frontend to achieve this.

## Features
- Easy-to-follow installation guides
- Pre-configured setup scripts
- Support for multiple platforms (starting with macOS)

## Getting Started
To get started with setting up a NixOS aarch64 VM on macOS using UTM, follow the instructions provided in the [installation guide](./docs/installation_guide_utm.md).
